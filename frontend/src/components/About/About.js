                As the Saudi Arabian Government is keen to preserve the health
                and safety of citizens and residents within its soil from the
                risk of the spread of novel coronavirus; The Saudi Data and
                Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) developed Tawakkalna
                App in order to support government efforts aimed at countering
                Covid-19. Tawakkalna App was developed to facilitate the
                issuance of movement permits electronically during the curfew
                period for government and private sector employees, as well as
                individuals, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and all
                relevant authorities during the curfew, thus helping to reduce
                the spread of the pandemic in the Kingdom. Tawakkalna helps
                individuals, security, health and private entities, that are
                exempted from the curfew, to automatize all transactions between
                relevant parties in order to mitigate the health, economic and
                social impacts that may result from the implementation of
                policies taken to eliminate the spread of Covid-19. Now, as we
                cautiously return to normal life, Tawakkalna is helping in this
                phase by new services such as showing Users??? health condition
                and other services. And as a part of promoting social
                responsibility, Tawakkalna has provided many services regarding
                raising concern if there are violations, as well as providing
                the ability to notify Ministry of Health in the event of a
                suspected case.
